Inheritance 1
Create a new class called Computer. Before you add any more code, know that you will need to add two additional classes:
Laptop and SmartPhone
For a parent class add 3 properties, 2 methods, and a constructor.
For a child class add at least 1 additional property and 1 additional method.
In the main method create a Laptop and a SmartPhone

Modelling
We have to create the classes for a School.
This school have different employees ðŸ‘‡
Teacher
Janitor
Headmaster
It admin
There are also classes (as in a school class not a java class). A class can have a list of students and a name.
A school can have a list of classes and a list of employees.
Try and think about the different classes you would need to solve this problem. First write the plan down.
When you have a plan start writing the actual classes to solve this problem.
The functionality inside the methods is not important, but the classes and the class structure is!
For the employees, make a parent class. Think about what specific attributes you would have for the different roles

Interface 1
Create an interface called FastFood (with appropriate methods) and

Now iterate through that array and use some of the methods you have created above.
